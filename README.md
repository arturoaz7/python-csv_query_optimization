This Jupyter notebook consists of a small project in which we can observe the advantages of leveraging python data structures and the binary search algorithm to optimize the process of fetching information. We do so by creating an Inventory class which will contain a set of laptops with their attributes and class methods with a standard and an optimized version to perform certain queries on the data.
